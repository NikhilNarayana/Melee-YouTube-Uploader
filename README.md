# Melee-YouTube-Uploader

A YouTube Uploader for my Melee recordings

A modified version of FRC-YouTube-Uploader for Video Game Tournaments.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

This application **DOES NOT/CANNOT** support enabling monetization due to YouTube's API restrictions. Thus by default videos are uploaded as unlisted so you can set monetization settings before making them public. Optionally you can update monetization settings as they are uploaded without breaking anything.

## To Do

- Automate creation of thumbnails
- Slippi Integration (plan is to allow pulling characters from the slippi stream, additional ideas are appreciated).
- Maybe other stuff

## Contributing

PRs are appreciated and will be reviewed quickly, the only code quality standard I have is to follow PEP8 standard except for the line length. If you have trouble understanding my code just ask me.

## Questions and Support

I am always open to help setup the program or fix any techincal issues you may have. Please send me a DM on twitter with your issue and I'll get you sorted out.

## Current Feature Set:

- Upload videos
- Manual or automatic file selection
- Queue and dequeue Videos to upload (Queue items can be modified)
- Add relevant YouTube tags
- Make and add to playlists
- Load old uploads from history
- Save a queue to be uploaded later
- Melee, Ultimate, Smash 64, Rivals of Aether, Splatoon<sup>\*</sup> and Custom Character Lists
- Hook into Scoreboard Assistant, Stream Control, Streameta, and OBS
- Automatic Updates (sometimes)

<sup>\*</sup>There are no characters in the list, but this does set splatoon specific tags which are useful

## How to Setup - Video Version: https://youtu.be/zrcf4t_qk5A

1. Install [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your OS with the PATH added and make sure there are no other versions of Python 3.
2. Install the program by typing `pip3 install -I meleeuploader` into Command Prompt/Terminal. If you want untested features you can download the repo and install with `pip3 install -I /path/to/repo`
3. Start the program by running `meleeuploader` for the Melee character list or `smashuploader` for the Ultimate character list in Command Prompt/Terminal.
4. Select the YouTube profile you would like to use and then ensure the program is given all the privileges so it can upload videos.
5. Add in the necessary info in the Event Values and Match Values tabs
6. Hit submit when the match finishes.
7. Update forms with the next match's info.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 and enjoy not having to deal with YouTube's front end ðŸŽ‰.

### Create Your Own Credentials

In the future I will not be including YouTube API credentials with this project. So here is a guide to create your own credentials.

1. Open the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. Hit the `Select Project` button near the top and create a new project.
3. Once the project is created, select the project.
4. Hit the `Enable APIs and Services` button and enable the YouTube Data API V3 and the Google Sheets API.
5. Once the APIs are enabled it will tell you to create credentials and there will be a button to press.
6. Google will ask you to setup an Oauth consent screen. Set the consent screen to internal and then only add an application name. Hit save to exit that page and then click `Credentials` on the left tab.
7. Hit `Create Credentials` -> `OAuth client ID`, select other from the options given, and then type any name you want. Hit save.
8. Select the name of your new credentials in the `OAuth 2.0 Client IDs` section. Then select `Download JSON` at the top.
9. Once you have downloaded your credentails remember to rename them `client_secrets.json` (if you don't see the `.json` when renaming the file just use `client_secrets`) and put the file in `C:\Users\[Your Username]\` or, if you are on macOS or Unix, whatever `echo ~` returns in terminal. macOS users can also just do `open ~` to open a Finder window at that directory.
10. If you already created YouTube Account credentials for the program, open the program and select `Settings -> Remove YouTube Credentials`

### Additional Setup Options

#### Windows

If you want to launch the application easily, you can find the exe by hitting the Windows key and typing `meleeuploader`, if that doesn't show the option to run the command then you can probably find the exe at `C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts\`. Pinning the exe to the taskbar allows quick access to the program.

If you would like to have no console window on your screen, you will need to find out where your pythonw.exe file is (it should be in the same place your python.exe) and create a shortcut to it. Then open the shortcut properties window and edit the target to include `-m meleeuploader` for Melee, `-m meleeuploader ult` for Ultimate, `-m meleeuploader 64` for 64, `-m meleeuploader rivals` for Rivals, or `-m meleeuploader splatoon` for Splatoon at the end. This can then be pinned to your taskbar for easy access. This method does not allow authenticating yourself so you will have to fall back to CMD/Terminal for that part.

#### Mac and Unix

`meleeuploader &` if you want to hide the terminal window. There are probably ways to launch the program quicker, but I don't use macOS/Linux for uploading.

## How to use each field

### Required

`Event Name`, `Title Format`, `Video Privacy`, `File`, `Match Type`, and `Player Tags` are the only required fields for uploading any file.

#### File

File is able to be used as either a file or directory input. Because of how the input selector is setup you will need to either type out the directory address or select a file within the directory you wish to use and then you can delete the filename from the field. If you select a directory the field will not be cleared after submission.

When using the directory feature, it will find the newest file in the directory you give it, so make sure no other files are written to this folder other than the recordings. This is best used for uploading or queueing videos during an event.

#### Title Format

All the options support no characters and the available options can be expanded upon on request.

### Optional

#### Match Type Prefix and Suffix

These are fairly self explanatory, you can add a bit of text before and after the `Match Type`. When submitting the video the `Prefix` is kept while the `Suffix` is cleared.

#### Sponsor Tag

This field will be added to the player tag like so `{sponsor} | {player}` resulting in names like `TSM | Leffen`.

#### Characters

Melee characters are currently ordered by tier list placing, according to the 2021 PGStats tier list.

Ultimate characters are currently ordered by the default character select screen without echo stacking.
If you don't add any characters for either player, both players will not have characters in the title.

Characters that are selected will be in the order they are shown in the list, not the selected order (unfortunate issue with the GUI framework).

You can swap the character list using the menu bar or load the preferred character list by using `meleeuploader` for Melee, `smashuploader` for Ultimate, `s64uploader` for Smash 64, `rivalsuploader` for Rivals, and `splatoonuploader` for Splatoon.
There is also the option to load your own character list, instructions can be found at the bottom.

#### YouTube PlaylistID

The URL of the playlist after creation can be put here, the program will trim it to just the part it needs. The URL should look like `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSCJwgNAP2cXdlHlwbZr38JDHuuc8vx_s`, if the address has a string with `PL` at the start, it should work.

If you want to generate a playlist you can also do that by typing in a playlist name. Make sure it doesn't contain "PL" anywhere in the name otherwise it will fail.

#### Bracket Link

Adds a direct link to the bracket at the top of the description. Any URL will work here, just make sure to include `https://` so YouTube users can click on the link in the description.

#### Tags

If you want to add additional tags, for a specific event or your channel, add them here. Separate the tags with commas and don't worry about leading or trailing spaces.

Also multiple tags about the game selected and the players are added by the program so don't add any related to those in this field.

#### Description

Additional text can be added to the description here, it will go between the bracket link and the credit text. If you would like to put the bracket link in a different spot, don't input anything in `Bracket Link` and instead insert your format in `Description`.

#### Submit

The submit button does a lot, it adds submission to queue, clears fields in match values that aren't generally needed for consecutive matches, and prevents you from adding submissions that don't meet the minimum criteria.

## How to use advanced features - Video Version: https://youtu.be/mw0sP7YJVfE

### History - Fixing an upload that didn't work

History was built so I could fix uploads that exceeded the title limit on YouTube (100 characters). This actually happens very rarely now because I've employed a number of tricks to minify the title as much as possible.

By loading the history window from the menubar, you can double click any row in the list to reload the form with the values you inputted for that submission. Every submission will create a new entry, but the history window is only updated on load, you will need to close and reopen it to see new entries.

### Queue - Saving uploads for later

Queue was built so I could upload VODs after an event because the venue didn't have the bandwidth to support streaming and uploading simultaneously.

Queue refers to the list of upcoming uploads in the status tab. By selecting `Toggle Uploads` you can toggle the uploading function, but continue to add entries to the queue. Once you have finished adding all the VODs you want to upload, selecting `Save Queue` will write the entire queue to your disk to be loaded later on. Finally, using `Load Queue` will load the entire queue file and start uploading immediately.

You can also load the queue on startup by running `<uploader command> -q`. This will instantly load whatever is in the queue and start uploading. If you don't want to start uploading then you should use the usual method.

Items in the queue can also be modified by double clicking the queue item in the queue list and then changing one of the cells in the right column of the window that appears.

### Scoreboard Assistant Websocket - Never retype anything

SA Websocket was built so I could avoid retyping information that I put into Scoreboard Assistant.

To enable the websocket open the `Settings` menu tab and select the `Enable Websocket` option. Just make sure that SA is open before you start the websocket.

The program will pull from the `Player 1`, `Player 2`, and `Match` fields. The `Match` field will be parsed to find which of the match types defined in the program are a substring, then it will split the input at the substring and update `Match Prefix` and `Match Suffix` with whatever is left over. For example, `Doubles - Winners R1` as the input would result in `Doubles -` and `R1` being the prefix and suffix respectively.

There is also support for character selection if you use stock icons from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8M-4FUDcQo-2cuh1Ak_VabJSQlWz8B_/view?usp=sharing).

### StreamControl and Streameta Integration

This integration is similar to the SA websocket but is done by polling a file or HTTP endpoint respectively. The SC integration is flexible, just map your `streamcontrol.json` to the fields in the uploader.

### OBS Websocket - Never submit manually

I've set it up so once recording has been stopped, you can have the application either submit the information that is currently inputted or stop updating the form if you are using a SA/SC/Streameta hook. This combined with `SA Websocket` or `SC/Streameta Integration` makes it effortless to quickly queue sets without touching the program

In addition to enabling the settings you will need to update OBS with the websocket plugin found here: https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket

### Custom Character List

You can add your own custom character lists by putting comma separated names in a file called `.smash_custom_list.txt` in the smashuploader config folder which is in your root directory.  
If you don't know where your root directory is, open the program and select `Characters -> Custom` and the program will make a blank text file where it is supposed to be.
